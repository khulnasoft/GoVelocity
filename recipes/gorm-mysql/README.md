   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. Configure the database connection in the `config.json` file:
    ```json
    {
      "DB_Username": "your_db_username",
      "DB_Password": "your_db_password",
      "DB_Name": "your_db_name",
      "DB_Host": "localhost",
      "DB_Port": "3306"
    }
    ```

Examples on how to run an application using Fiber on Google Cloud and connecting to Firebase Realtime Database.

## Running Locally

* Run on the command line:
```
go run cmd/main.go
```

## Deploy using Google Cloud Run

This step will build a Docker Image, publish to Google Cloud Registry and deploy on Cloud Run Managed enviroment.

Just follow the steps and fill the `GCP_PROJECT` variable with your Google Cloud Platform project ID. That variable is needed to connect to Firebase.

After deploying the server on Cloud Run, you can get it's url on GCP Console ([link](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)) and select the service `gcloud-fiber-firebase` that we just deployed. Then copy the URL. It will look like `https://{project-id}-{some-random-hash-string}.a.run.app`.

Or you can do it manually with those steps:

* Run on the command line:
```
export GCLOUD_PROJECT=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud builds submit â€” -tag gcr.io/$GCLOUD_PROJECT/gcloud-fiber-firebase .
gcloud beta run deploy --platform managed --image gcr.io/$GCLOUD_PROJECT/gcloud-fiber-firebase \
 --set-env-vars GCP_PROJECT=$GCLOUD_PROJECT
```

## Deploy using Google App Engine

This step will deploy the app to Google App Engine Standard Go enviroment. The app configuration and additional configurations can be tweaked on the `app.yaml` file.

* Run on the command line:
```
gcloud app deploy
```

## Deploy using Google Cloud Function

This step will deploy a HTTP Cloud Function using Go enviroment. You can use the `deploy.sh` script. Just edit your project id on it.

For the Cloud Functions env, Google enforces us to deploy a function that is a `http.HandlerFunc`, so on the file `functions.go` there is a workaround to reroute the HTTP call to the Fiber app instance.

* Run on the command line:
```
gcloud functions deploy HeroesAPI --runtime go111 --trigger-http
```
